'srcfv' folder includes BROADCAST source
-> Compilation inside this folder must be done to run the code

'misc' folder includes Jacobian construction and all PETSc functions
-> Compilation inside this folder must be done to run the code

'ADFirstAidKit' folder to compute the adjoint through TAPENADE software
-> unnecessary for BROADCAST

'SIM' folder includes the self-similar profile generator program
-> useful to initialise boundary layer simulations

#### TO COMPILE BROADCAST:
run all the python compilation programs in the main folder, misc/ and srcfv/:
python compile*

#### Boundary Layer case files:

## To compute the baseflow of a boundary layer

card_bl2d_fv.py -> Python card to run BROADCAST code, call BROADCAST.py
-> Must be fill in by the user (Numerical param., BROADCAST options...)
BROADCAST.py -> main program, call the functions compiled in 'srcfv' and 'misc' folders
-> Must be fill in by the user (Mesh, Adim. choice, BC location and type...)
card_bl2d_fv_cgns.py & BROADCAST_cgns.py -> same program with a CGNS output (require Cassiopee library)
BROADCAST_split_func.py -> equal to BROADCAST.py, only different organisation

meshBL.py -> functions to build different cartesian stretched mesh
restart_init.py -> functions to read previous solution to restart simulation (only for cartesian rectangular grids)
interpgrid.py -> 1st order interpolation functions only for cartesian rectangular grids
compilef90.py -> compile initialisation.f90 and set_bnd.f90
initialisation.f90 -> approximated initialisation of blasius profile
set_bnd.f90 -> functions which fill the ref. state inside the BC

## For resolvent (global stability) analysis of a boundary layer

DzMatrix.py -> Compute the transverse (z-direction) contributions to the Jacobian for 3D stability
computeBLthickness -> Compute different boundary layer thicknesses, it can be used to restrict the resolvent
resolvent_all.py -> main functions to perform 2D resolvent analysis, call add. functions inside MISC/PETSc_func.py
resolvent_all3D_1block.py -> main functions to perform 3D resolvent analysis

#### Cylinder case files:

## To compute the baseflow of a cylinder

card_cyl2d.py -> Python card to run BROADCAST code for cylinder, call cylinder.py
-> Must be fill in by the user (Numerical param., BROADCAST options...)
cylinder.py -> main program, call the functions compiled in 'srcfv' and 'misc' folders
-> Must be fill in by the user (Mesh, Adim. choice, BC location and type...)

meshCyl.py -> functions to build O-mesh for cylinder

## For global stability analysis of a cylinder

DzMatrix_cyl.py -> Compute the transverse (z-direction) contributions to the Jacobian for 3D stability
biglobal_cyl.py -> main functions to perform 2D/3D (bi)global stability analysis, call add. functions inside MISC/PETSc_func.py

## To compute eigenvalue sensitivity of a cylinder

Product_Adjoint.py -> Normalise adjoint and direct modes with L2 norm or any other user's instructions
Hessian_cyl.py -> Compute the product of the Hessian operator with a user-provided mode
ProductHessian_cyl.py -> Apply the result returned by Hessian_cyl.py to the adjoint mode to compute the eigenvalue sensitivity

## To compute the coefficients of the Weakly Nonlinear Stability analysis (Sipp, Lebedev JFM 2007)

limitcycle_part_all.py -> compute the modes x22 & x20 and the coefficients \mu & \nu

Guidelines for Weakly Nonlinear Stability coefficients computation:
1. Compute direct mode with biglobal_cyl.py
2. Compute adjoint mode with biglobal_cyl.py
3. Normalise direct & adjoint modes with Product_Adjoint.py
4. Compute Hessian associated with the direct mode with Hessian_cyl.py
5. Compute modes x22 & x20 and the coefficients \mu & \nu with limitcycle_part_all.py
